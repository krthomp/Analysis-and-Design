# Analysis-and-Design

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
- In Project One the problem involved analyzing the run-time and memory usage of various data structures. The goal of the project was to determine which data structure was most efficient for a specific task.
- In Project Two the problem involved creating a program to sort and print out a list of courses. This required selecting a data structure and algorithms to ensure the sorting was done correctly. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
- Data structures play a role in the efficiency and performance of software programs.
- In Project One, I evaluated the characteristics of different data structures, such as linked lists, trees, and arrays. The considering factors were the access time, insertion and/or deletion time, and memory usage.
- In Project Two, I selected an efficient sorting algorithm that could handle the course list effectively. This ensured the final output was correct and has the best performance. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
- The roadblocks I encountered was to collaborate with fellow members of the class to answer a question. Other times, I utilized the tutor help that SNHU offers their students/ This offers a quick response at any time of the day.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
- These projects reinforced the importance of choosing the right data structure and algorithm based on the problem at hand. I developed the prioritization of both performance and maintainability. I do understand the trade-off between different approaches has also broadened my perspective on how to make design decisions. 


How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
- My work on these projects has improved my coding practices significantly. I now place a greater emphasis on writing clean, modular code that is easy to read and maintain. This includes better commenting, consistent naming conventions, and designing functions that can be easily modified or extended. I have learned to consider future scalability and potential changes that might require the code to be adapted.
